# Understanding L4S: Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput

## What is L4S?

L4S (Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput) is a new internet architecture that improves how data is sent and received, making online experiences faster, smoother, and more responsive. It reduces delays caused by network congestion, making it ideal for modern applications like video conferencing, gaming, and cloud-based services.

## Why Do We Need L4S?

Today’s internet can experience delays when too many applications send data at the same time. Traditional methods create long queues of data, leading to high latency (delays) that impact the quality of video calls, games, and other time-sensitive activities.

L4S solves this by:

-   Reducing delays to less than 1 millisecond.
-   Allowing high data throughput without causing data loss.
-   Ensuring smoother and faster internet experiences for all kinds of applications.

## Key Components of L4S

1. **Scalable Congestion Control (at the Sender)**: The sender adjusts how quickly data is sent based on network conditions, avoiding long queues and keeping data flowing smoothly.

2. **Active Queue Management (AQM, at the Network Bottleneck)**: The network manages data queues by monitoring them and preventing them from growing too large, ensuring low latency.

3. **Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)**: The network sends warning signals (ECN) to the sender when congestion starts, allowing the sender to slow down before queues build up.

## How Does L4S Work?

1. **Sending Data**: Devices use scalable congestion control to adjust the data sending rate dynamically, avoiding large surges of data that could overwhelm the network.

2. **Managing Queues**: The network uses AQM to keep the queue size small by quickly signaling back to the sender when it’s time to slow down.

3. **Handling Congestion**: When the network starts to get congested, ECN signals are sent to the sender to prevent further buildup. The sender responds by reducing its sending rate.

4. **Coexisting with Classic Systems**: L4S is designed to work alongside older systems, so networks can handle both types of traffic without performance issues.

## Visual Representation Ideas

1. **Data Flow Comparison**: Show a traditional network with long delays versus L4S with minimal delays and smaller queues.
2. **ECN Signaling**: Visualize the ECN warning signals being sent from the network bottleneck back to the sender.
3. **Active Queue Management**: Create a visual of how AQM prevents queues from growing too large, keeping traffic flowing.
4. **Classic vs L4S Queues**: Demonstrate how L4S and classic traffic coexist with separate queues, ensuring both can function without disrupting each other.

## Benefits of L4S

-   **Low Latency**: Delays reduced to less than 1 millisecond.
-   **High Throughput**: More data can be sent quickly without congestion.
-   **Better Performance**: Improved internet experiences for gaming, video calls, and more.
-   **Seamless Transition**: Works alongside existing systems, making it easier to adopt.

## Conclusion

L4S improves the way data is sent over the internet by reducing delays, preventing data loss, and allowing high data throughput. It’s especially beneficial for modern applications that require low latency, like gaming, video conferencing, and cloud services. By introducing smarter congestion control, queue management, and signaling, L4S creates a faster and more efficient internet.
